- 👋 Hi, I'm @mpql. I'm usually tired. 🥱
- 💞️ I'm interested in video games, tech, infosec, DIY / repair, and dancing.
- 👀 I enjoy learning stuff with other folks, so I _might_ be interested in collaboratation on anything we can learn together!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning / practicing:
  - AWS Lambda
  - (improving) Python
  - SnapLogic
  - Test-Driven Development
- 🌠 I plan to learn:
  - [rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)
  - [golang](https://github.com/golang/go)
  - (improve) carpentry (I'm a novice)
  - metalworking / blacksmithing at some point (I want to be able to make tools and parts to fix stuff)
- 📫 How to reach me:
  - [Open a Discussion](https://github.com/mpql/mpql/discussions) for publicly-visible questions
  - [Use my contact form](https://mpql.net/contact/)

I'll update this to be more exciting later (maybe)~
